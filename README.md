# MNIGClustBayes
A Bayesian approach for clustering skewed data using mixtures of multivariate normal-inverse Gaussian distributions

A clustering algorithm based on mixture of MNIG distribution is proposed. Clusterin and parameter estimation are done through a full Bayesian approach via Gibbs Sampling

The program_2var.r file provides the code to a simulation study where 2 groups of 2-variate MNIG observation are simulated and sent to the clustering algorithm.
